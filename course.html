                <h3>Code</h3>
                <p>Embarking on my coding journey around two years ago, I've delved into the realms of Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, acquiring a diverse skill set. To ensure seamless development, I've integrated my projects with GitHub, providing a robust and secure foundation for building and troubleshooting. This proactive approach ensures a fully responsive and error-resistant website, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and proficiency in the coding landscape.</p>

I've actively sought avenues for skill enhancement, channeling my creativity into intricate sketches of animals and captivating scenery. This not only serves as a personal source of entertainment but also provides a platform to showcase my artistic endeavors to a wider audience, marking a transformative journey from idle doodles to purposeful and engaging expressions of creativity.

                <h3>Sports</h3>
                <p>I have a keen interest in sports that involve handheld rackets, regardless of their size or shape. From spirited table tennis matches in my garage to engaging tennis sessions with my dad, and the nimble moves of badminton, I find joy in the varied dynamics of racket sports. Beyond the enjoyment of these games, I appreciate the dual benefit of fun and exercise, actively working out my arms and legs while sharing quality time with my parents.

            <p> As devout Hindus, my family and I ardently follow the teachings of Lord Krishna, finding solace and well-being in his divine guidance. Our religious practices are intertwined with a rich tapestry of culinary delights, including the indulgence in traditional treats such as ladoos, samosas, and an array of delectable Indian sweets and savories. The vibrant tapestry of our cultural celebrations comes alive during festivals like Holi and Diwali, where we joyously partake in the colorful revelry, commemorating the victory of good over evil with the jubilant festivities marking the demise of Ravan.</p>
